# start_ionic_app
I'm using this ionic app repo for initialize my ionic apps.

It's include:
1- Login: using "satellizer" with JWT API (Login by username and password)
2- translate: using "agular-translate"
3- "For horizontal Select items": ionic-advanced-carousel

Feel free to use it as a bootstrap for your ionic project
